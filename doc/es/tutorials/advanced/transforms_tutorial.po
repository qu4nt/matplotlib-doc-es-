msgid "Like any graphics packages, Matplotlib is built on top of a transformation framework to easily move between coordinate systems, the userland *data* coordinate system, the *axes* coordinate system, the *figure* coordinate system, and the *display* coordinate system. In 95% of your plotting, you won't need to think about this, as it happens under the hood, but as you push the limits of custom figure generation, it helps to have an understanding of these objects so you can reuse the existing transformations Matplotlib makes available to you, or create your own (see :mod:`matplotlib.transforms`).  The table below summarizes the some useful coordinate systems, the transformation object you should use to work in that coordinate system, and the description of that system. In the ``Transformation Object`` column, ``ax`` is a :class:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes` instance, and ``fig`` is a :class:`~matplotlib.figure.Figure` instance."

The transformations also know how to invert themselves, to go from *display* back to the native coordinate system.

Therefore it is most common for artists placed in an axes or figure to have their transform set to something *other* than the `~.transforms.IdentityTransform()`; the default when an artist is placed on an axes using `~.axes.Axes.add_artist` is for the transform to be ``ax.transData``."

This is because the display point was computed before the figure was displayed, and the GUI backend may slightly resize the figure when it is created. The effect is more pronounced if you resize the figure yourself. This is one good reason why you rarely want to work in *display* space, but you can connect to the ``'on_draw'`` :class:`~matplotlib.backend_bases.Event` to update *figure* coordinates on figure draws; see :ref:`event-handling-tutorial`."

Here the point (0, 0) is the bottom left of your axes or subplot, (0.5, 0.5) is the center, and (1.0, 1.0) is the top right.  You can also refer to points outside the range, so (-0.1, 1.1) is to the left and above your axes.  This coordinate system is extremely useful when placing text in your axes, because you often want a text bubble in a fixed, location, e.g., the upper left of the axes pane, and have that location remain fixed when you pan or zoom.  Here is a simple example that creates four panels and labels them 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D' as you often see in journals."

Nonetheless, here is a silly example which plots some random dots in data space, and overlays a semi-transparent :class:`~matplotlib.patches.Circle` centered in the middle of the axes with a radius one quarter of the axes -- if your axes does not preserve aspect ratio (see :meth:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes.set_aspect`), this will look like an ellipse.  Use the pan/zoom tool to move around, or manually change the data xlim and ylim, and you will see the data move, but the circle will remain fixed because it is not in *data* coordinates and will always remain at the center of the axes."

There is an efficiency here, because you can pan and zoom in your axes which affects the affine transformation, but you may not need to compute the potentially expensive nonlinear scales or projections on simple navigation events.  It is also possible to multiply affine transformation matrices together, and then apply them to coordinates in one step.  This is not true of all possible transformations."
