"One common cause for unexpected tick behavior is passing a list of "
"strings instead of numbers or datetime objects. This can easily happen "
"without notice when reading in a comma-delimited text file. Matplotlib "
"treats lists of strings as *categorical* variables "
"(:doc:`/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/categorical_variables`), and by "
"default puts one tick per category, and plots them in the order in which "
"they are supplied.  If this is not desired, the solution is to convert "
"the strings to a numeric type as in the following examples."
